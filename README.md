This is my NVIM settings! Goodbye having kids!!!!

" Some people wonder if having kids is a life goal of mine
It is, but everytime I feel like I'm one step closer to my goal I realize,
that I am a Neovim user. "  - Some guy, It's fucking me, I'm the guy. Like who else sat down and thought it was a great quote?


```git clone https://www.github.com/Levi-kun/nvim```

past this into your .comfig/nvim folder!
and you'll have the same shit that I do.
